# Methodology Assignment 5, Task 2

1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

   The most interesting topic we covered in the domain this quarter was Graph Convolution. We dove into the details of the loss function used in the GraphSAGE methodology to accurately predict embeddings of new nodes never seen before in a given graph.
   
3. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

   A potential problem I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 project is in regards to ecDNA or extrachromosomal DNA, which doesn't reside on a particular chromosome. This makes it challenging to identify, however, deep learning methods such as computer vision can be applied to help predict which parts of a cell's DNA are ecDNA.
   
5. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

   In retrospect, a potential change I'd make to the approach we've taken in Quarter 1 would be to have a slightly more structured curriculum aimed at a specific topic. Although I appreciate and understand the flexibility that's been granted to us, it was especially confusing delving into complex biological concepts from purely a data science background. However, I understand that this emulates the research process and the ambiguity that comes with it.
   
7. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

   Some other techniques I'd be interested in using would be concepts such as attention and transformers to elevate the complexity of a graph convolution model. While these techniques have been heavily applied in LLMs, I'm curious how well they would perform within this specific context.
